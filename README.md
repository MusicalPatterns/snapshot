# Musical Patterns - Snapshot

When inside the directory of a pattern for which you want to update the snapshot, run:

```
mps
```

This snapshot is used by the snapshot test to ensure the pattern stays locked down unless you mean to change it.
When you import a published pattern, you can import either the snapshot, or the pattern if you want to customize it before performing by configuring its spec and recompiling it.
